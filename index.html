                        <h3> Zoe's Advice</h3>
                            <p> I have heard rumours about the dreaded 5 stages of web development and armed with my limited experiance I thought that I would share some tips and inspriration on how I deal with the 5 stages.</p>
                   <h2> The Five Emotional Stages to Web Deverlopment</h2>
                        <h3> 1. The I can't fix this stage </h3>
                            <p> This stage normally kicks in when you are presented with some messy, broken or just downright unintelligible project, take a huge breath, grab some coffee and look at the below meme, then get back to it!</p>
                                <div class="img">
                                    <img src="./img/meme1..jpg" alt="You is kind meme"/>
                                </div>

                         <h3> 5. The 'Oh! It was a typo' stage </h3>
                            <p> This is when you have been to hell and back with your code, everything you have done, everyone you have asked (including your rubber duck) haven't been able to help and in sweaty desperation you have chugged some luke warm coffee and re-read your code in every which direction and found...... GASP! A typo, you fix it and everything now works!</p>
